# Introduction 
 
   The Accident Forecast aims to predict road fatalities occurring in the previous year in which year, during which month, there were most or least accidents on the roads of the past year. in order for people to be more careful when driving vehicles And the traffic will improve people's driving of vehicles to be more careful on the road.

# Working of ANTICIPATING AN ACCIDENT 

  How the accident forecasting program works We have to include data on the road accidents and fatalities of many years in the program. The more information we have Calculation accuracy will also be higher. But if we put less data, the calculation accuracy will be less as well. and after the program has been processed It will show as a graph for us to see all the data more easily.

# Problem Statement 

  The main problem in the program we are working on is road accidents and fatalities. So we made a road accident prediction program. In order for the road traffic to function at its best, use this program to calculate the least possible road accidents.

# CONCLUSION 

  Car accidents account for approximately 3% of global GDP and are also the leading cause of death among children and young adults. And accidents tend to repeat in the same spot, often twice. So we've created an accident forecasting program that can predict car crashes and identify high-risk areas to deal with them. from the developed high-resolution risk map It is based on data from past car crashes, road maps, satellite images ,graph images and GPS tracking.
